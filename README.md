SCllmk: SC-Variant of [llmk] (the Light LaTeX Make)
---------------------------------------------------

[llmk]: https://github.com/wtsnjp/llmk

This is yet another *essential* tool for Snowman Comedians. The features of **scllmk** are:

* works solely with texlua,
* the source file can be in TOML, YAML, JSON, XML, LaTeX, SATySFi, or
  any other format; or can be free mixture of those formats,
* the source file even need not exist since the content or existence of the
  source files is not *essential* at all,
* no complicated or simplistic configuration, and
* modern fixed settings (always using LuaTeX!)
